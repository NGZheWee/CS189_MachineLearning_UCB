# CS189: Introduction to Machine Learning (Fall 2024, UCB)

This repository contains coursework from **CS189: Introduction to Machine Learning**, which I took in Fall 2024 at UC Berkeley. The course explores the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of machine learning algorithms, focusing on statistical analysis, optimization, and generalization.

## Contents:

- **Homework**: Contains homework assignments focused on implementing and analyzing machine learning algorithms.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Supervised Learning**: Understanding regression, classification, and the bias-variance tradeoff.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Exploring clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, such as k-means and principal component analysis (PCA).
- **Optimization**: Techniques for minimizing loss functions, including gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.
- **Generalization**: Concepts like overfitting, regularization, and cross-validation.
- **Neural Networks**: Introduction to deep learning models, including feedforward and convolutional neural networks.
- **Bayesian Methods**: Understanding probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian inference.
- **Kernel Methods**: Applications of support vector machines (SVMs) and kernel tricks for non-linear decision boundaries.

## How to Navigate:

- **Homework**: The `Homework/` directory contains assignments that include code implementations and theoretical problem sets. Each assignment focuses on specific machine learning algorithms and concepts.


Explore the coursework to see how machine learning principles are implemented and analyzed, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. This repository highlights my understanding of the fundamental building blocks of machine learning and its applications.
